# AgentNet Refactoring Plan

This document outlines a concrete refactoring plan for the `V1B3hR/agentnet` repository, guided by established software engineering principles and tailored to AgentNet’s architecture and goals.

---

## Repository Overview

**AgentNet** is a modular, policy-governed multi-agent reasoning framework for orchestrating LLM-based dialogues, monitoring, persistence, and extensible tool/provider adapters. Its architecture is phased, supporting features such as multi-agent debate, rule/policy enforcement, memory layers, cost tracking, RBAC, observability (metrics/tracing/logs), and more.

### Key Functional Modules

- **Core Agent:** Cognitive agent with style modulation, async dialogue, reasoning graphs, and persistence.
- **Policy Engine:** Rule-based constraint and policy evaluation.
- **Monitoring:** Per-turn/final-output monitors, fault injection, and resilience.
- **Providers:** Adapter interfaces for inference engines (OpenAI, Anthropic, local, etc.).
- **Memory System:** Short-term, episodic, and semantic memory layers.
- **Task Orchestration:** DAG planner, scheduler, and evaluation suite.
- **Governance & RBAC:** Role-based access control, policy enforcement.
- **Cost Tracking:** Provider/tenant-aware cost recording and pricing.
- **Observability:** Metrics collection, tracing, and structured logging.
- **Plugins/Compliance:** Audit logging, content redaction, export control.

## Refactoring Plan

### 1. Identify Pain Points

- **Legacy Entrypoints:** Maintain backward compatibility for legacy imports (e.g., `AgentNet_legacy.py`).
- **Monolithic Classes:** Large classes/functions (e.g., AgentNet) should be split by responsibility.
- **Duplicated Logic:** Consolidate redundant monitor, provider, and memory logic across files.
- **Complex Imports:** Phase-conditional imports and feature stubbing can be clarified and modularized.
- **Testing Coverage:** Ensure baseline functionality is covered by automated tests before changes.

### 2. Establish Baseline Functionality

- Audit existing test coverage for critical modules (core agent, policy engine, monitors, memory).
- Document current behaviors and outputs—especially for orchestration, monitoring, and persistence.

### 3. Select Refactoring Techniques

- **Extract Method/Class:** Split large classes (AgentNet, MonitorManager) into focused components.
- **Rename for Clarity:** Clearly name all classes/functions per their domain (e.g., ProviderAdapter, MemoryLayer).
- **Remove Dead Code:** Eliminate unused legacy logic after confirming no breakage.
- **Flatten Imports:** Replace deeply nested or phase-dependent imports with explicit module boundaries.
- **Split Monitors:** Separate monitor types (keyword, regex, resource, semantic) into distinct files.
- **Consolidate Duplicates:** Merge similar monitor/provider/memory logic across legacy and refactored code.
- **Guard Clauses:** Replace nested conditional logic with guard clauses for clearer flow.
- **Module Layout:** Align with proposed file/module structure ([see RoadmapAgentNet.md §26](docs/RoadmapAgentNet.md)), e.g.:
  ```
  agentnet/core/
    agent.py
    monitors/base.py
    monitors/keyword.py
    memory/base.py
    provider/base.py
    orchestration/dag_planner.py
    cost/pricing.py
    auth/rbac.py
  ```

### 4. Apply Refactoring Incrementally

- Make isolated, testable changes per module.
- Run existing and new tests after each change to confirm external behavior.
- Use feature flags or graceful degradation for optional/enterprise features.

### 5. Review and Document Changes

- Peer review all major refactoring PRs.
- Update module/class/function docstrings to reflect new responsibilities.
- Document any changes to public APIs in README and RoadmapAgentNet.md.

### 6. Monitor Performance and Maintainability

- Track key metrics (latency, memory, violations) before and after refactoring.
- Review cyclomatic complexity and maintainability indices.
- Solicit contributor feedback on onboarding and extensibility.

## Potential Advantages

- **Cleaner, Modular Architecture:** Eases onboarding and future feature addition.
- **Improved Readability:** Code is easier to follow, debug, and extend.
- **Lower Technical Debt:** Reduces risk of bugs and regressions.
- **Better Extensibility:** Facilitates plugins, new providers, and advanced features.
- **Enhanced Observability:** Metrics and tracing become easier to configure and review.
- **Performance Opportunities:** Modularization may enable targeted optimization.

> **Note:** Refactoring is an ongoing practice. Maintain discipline, automated testing, and code review to ensure AgentNet continues to evolve with high quality and robust functionality.
