# Roadmap Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the four key roadmap items identified for completion:

1. CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions workflows)
2. Provider ecosystem expansion (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure adapters)
3. Advanced governance (policy + tool lifecycle)
4. Risk register runtime enforcement & monitoring integration

## 1. CI/CD Automation ✅

### Implementation

Created three comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

#### Test Workflow (`test.yml`)

- Features:
  - Automated dependency installation
  - Full test suite execution with pytest
  - Coverage tracking and reporting
  - Codecov integration for coverage visualization
  - Pip caching for faster builds

#### Lint Workflow (`lint.yml`)
- Runs on: push to main/develop, pull requests
- Tools:
  - **ruff**: Fast Python linter
  - **mypy**: Static type checking
  - **bandit**: Security vulnerability scanning
- Features:
  - Continues on error to show all issues
  - Uploads security scan artifacts
  - GitHub-formatted output for inline PR comments

#### Docker Workflow (`docker.yml`)
- Runs on: push to main, tags, pull requests
- Features:
  - Multi-platform Docker builds with buildx
  - GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) integration

- **Deployment Ready**: Docker images built and versioned automatically
- **Developer Experience**: Fast feedback on code quality and test failures

## 2. Provider Ecosystem Expansion ✅

### Implementation

Implemented three production-ready provider adapters in `agentnet/providers/`:

#### OpenAI Adapter (`openai.py`)
- **Models**: GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo
- **Features**:
  - Synchronous and asynchronous inference
  - Streaming support with real-time chunks
  - Accurate cost calculation with current pricing
  - Token usage tracking

#### Azure OpenAI Adapter (`azure.py`)
- **Models**: All Azure-hosted OpenAI models
- **Features**:
  - Regional deployment support
  - API version configuration
  - Full compatibility with OpenAI features
  - Streaming support
  - Cost calculation for Azure pricing

### Common Features

All adapters implement:
- `infer()`: Synchronous inference

- **Future-Proof**: Easy to add more providers following the same pattern

## 3. Advanced Tool Governance ✅

### Implementation

Created comprehensive tool governance system in `agentnet/tools/governance.py`:

2. **TESTING**: Tool being tested
3. **APPROVED**: Tool approved but not yet active
4. **ACTIVE**: Tool in production use
5. **DEPRECATED**: Tool marked for retirement
6. **RETIRED**: Tool no longer available

#### Governance Levels
1. **PUBLIC**: No restrictions
2. **INTERNAL**: Requires internal authentication
3. **RESTRICTED**: Specific permissions required
4. **CONFIDENTIAL**: Highest security level

#### Features

**Access Control**:
- Tenant-based restrictions
- Role-based access control
- Configurable per tool

**Usage Management**:
- Total usage quota enforcement
- Daily usage limits
- Real-time usage tracking
- Automatic quota checks

**Lifecycle Management**:
- Status transitions with validation
- Approval workflows
- Deprecation with reasons
- Retirement scheduling

**Audit & Compliance**:

- Custom metadata support

### Testing

Comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_tool_governance.py`):
- 14 tests covering all governance features
- Lifecycle progression tests
- Access control validation
- Usage quota enforcement
- Audit logging verification
- 100% pass rate

### Impact

- **Controlled Rollout**: Tools progress through defined lifecycle stages
- **Security**: Governance levels ensure appropriate access control
- **Compliance**: Complete audit trail for all tool changes
- **Resource Management**: Usage quotas prevent abuse
- **Team Collaboration**: Clear ownership and approval workflows

## 4. Risk Register Runtime Enforcement ✅

### Implementation

Built comprehensive enforcement engine in `agentnet/risk/enforcement.py`:

#### Enforcement Rules

Rules define:
- **risk_type**: Type of risk to monitor
- **trigger_threshold**: Number of events before action
- **time_window_minutes**: Time period to count events
- **enforcement_action**: Action to take (block, throttle, alert, downgrade)
- **severity**: Risk level to match

#### Enforcement Actions

**Block**: Prevent target from system access
- Duration configurable
- Automatic expiration
- Target can be agent, session, or tenant

**Throttle**: Reduce usage rate
- Configurable rate multiplier
- Automatic expiration
- Per-target application

**Alert**: Send notifications
- Logged to system
- Extensible via callbacks
- Immediate notification

**Downgrade**: Reduce service level
- Switch to cheaper models
- Reduce feature access
- Cost optimization

#### Features

**Rule Management**:
- Add/remove enforcement rules
- Enable/disable rules dynamically
- Rule validation
- Default rules provided

**Runtime Enforcement**:
- Real-time risk event evaluation
- Automatic enforcement triggering
- Target tracking and management
- Enforcement history

**Callback System**:
- Register custom handlers
- Per-action-type callbacks
- Event and action information provided
- Extensible architecture

**Monitoring & Reporting**:
- Enforcement statistics
- Action history tracking
- Active rule listing
- Target status checking

#### Default Rules

Pre-configured rules for:
1. **Token cost spikes** → Auto-downgrade to cheaper models
2. **Provider outages** → Alert and trigger fallback
3. **Memory bloat** → Throttle usage
4. **Policy violations** → Alert on high rates

### Testing

Comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_risk_enforcement.py`):
- 9 tests covering all enforcement features
- Rule management tests
- Blocking and throttling tests
- Callback system validation
- Statistics and history tests
- 100% pass rate

### Impact

- **Proactive Protection**: Automatically respond to risk events
- **Cost Control**: Prevent budget overruns with automatic downgrades
- **Service Quality**: Throttle abuse while maintaining availability
- **Operational Excellence**: Alert teams to critical issues immediately
- **Customization**: Extensible via callbacks for custom enforcement logic

## Integration

All four components work together seamlessly:

1. **Provider adapters** track costs and usage
2. **Risk register** monitors for cost spikes and anomalies
3. **Enforcement engine** automatically downgrades expensive models
4. **Tool governance** ensures only approved tools can access providers
5. **CI/CD** validates all code changes automatically

### Example Workflow

```python
# 1. Configure provider
from agentnet.providers import OpenAIAdapter
provider = OpenAIAdapter(config={"api_key": "...", "model": "gpt-4"})

# 2. Set up tool governance
from agentnet.tools import ToolGovernanceManager
gov = ToolGovernanceManager()
gov.register_tool_metadata("my_tool", metadata)
gov.approve_tool("my_tool", approver="admin")

# 3. Enable risk enforcement
from agentnet.risk import RiskRegister, RiskEnforcementEngine
risk_register = RiskRegister()
enforcement = RiskEnforcementEngine(risk_register)
enforcement.add_enforcement_rule(cost_spike_rule)

# 4. Use the system - enforcement happens automatically
# Cost spike detected → Enforcement triggered → Model downgraded → Alert sent
```

## Testing Summary

All implementations include comprehensive test coverage:

| Test Suite | Tests | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Provider Adapters | 12 | ✅ All Pass |
| Tool Governance | 14 | ✅ All Pass |
| Risk Enforcement | 9 | ✅ All Pass |
| **Total** | **35** | **✅ 100%** |
