# AgentNet

Framework for policy-governed multi-agent LLM reasoning: dialogue, monitoring, and persistence. A modular cognitive agent system featuring rule/policy enforcement, multi-party debate, and asynchronous orchestration.

---

## Key Objectives

- Provide composable abstractions for multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems.
- Enforce policies and safety constraints during reasoning and tool interaction.
- Support multi-party debate / critique / arbitration patterns.
- Enable persistence of dialogue state, agent memory, and evaluative metadata.
- Offer monitoring, observability, and auditability (events, traces, policy decisions).
- Facilitate extension via tools, plugins, and custom policies.

## Core Concepts (Planned Abstractions)

| Concept | Role |
|--------|------|
| `Agent` | Encapsulates reasoning + tool invocation policy for a single cognitive unit. |
| `Policy` | Rule layer governing actions, messages, memory writes, tool access. |
| `DialogueOrchestrator` | Manages multi-agent turn-taking, debate, arbitration. |
| `MemoryStore` | Hybrid (structured + vector) store for episodic, semantic, and procedural memory. |
| `Monitor` | Event bus subscriber producing logs, metrics, traces, and safety reports. |
| `ToolInterface` | Unified protocol for external function / API / environment calls. |
| `Evaluator` | Scoring / critique modules for self-reflection or inter-agent assessment. |

## Installation (Placeholder)

```bash
# (Not yet published to PyPI)
git clone https://github.com/V1B3hR/agentnet
cd agentnet
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

---

## Quick Start (Planned Example)

```python
from agentnet import Agent, DialogueOrchestrator

policy = ...        # define or load policy
agent_a = Agent(name="Analyst", model="openai:gpt-4o", policy=policy)
agent_b = Agent(name="Critic", model="openai:gpt-4o", policy=policy)

orchestrator = DialogueOrchestrator(agents=[agent_a, agent_b], mode="debate", max_turns=6)

result = orchestrator.run(prompt="Evaluate the security posture of system X.")
print(result.final_resolution)
```

## Roadmap

### Phase 0 – Bootstrap & Skeleton
- [ ] Repository scaffolding (package layout, pyproject, deps)
- [ ] Core typing & base interfaces (`Agent`, `Policy`, `Tool`, `MemoryAdapter`, `MonitorSink`)
- [ ] Minimal orchestrator loop (single agent, linear turns)
- [ ] Basic logging + structured event model
- [ ] Development utilities: lint, format, test harness

### Phase 1 – Functional MVP
- [ ] Multi-agent orchestration (round-robin + configurable strategies)
- [ ] Pluggable model backend adapter (OpenAI / local inference shim)
- [ ] Policy engine (rule matching on: message content, action intents, tool invocations)
- [ ] Tool interface + sample tools (search, calculator, file read)
- [ ] Memory layer v1:
  - [ ] Short-term turn buffer
  - [ ] Vector embedding store (FAISS / Chroma backend)
  - [ ] Retrieval gating via policy
- [ ] Monitoring / event bus
  - [ ] JSON event emission
  - [ ] Basic console and file sink
- [ ] Safety hooks (content moderation placeholder abstraction)

### Phase 2 – Advanced Reasoning & Governance
- [ ] Debate / critique modes (adversarial, collaborative, arbiter)
- [ ] Self-reflection & revision loop (agent re-writes answer after critique)
- [ ] Arbitration strategies (score-based, confidence weighting, majority vote)
- [ ] Extended policy language (YAML or DSL with conditions + actions)
- [ ] Role-based tool permission model
- [ ] Structured memory (key-value / graph) + semantic tagging
- [ ] Audit trail export (OpenTelemetry or custom schema)
- [ ] Pluggable evaluation modules (truthfulness, complexity, safety)

### Phase 3 – Persistence, Scaling, Integrations
- [ ] Async orchestration (task graph / concurrent tool calls)
- [ ] Checkpoint & resume sessions
- [ ] Encrypted memory segments or redaction filters
- [ ] Web dashboard (live conversation + metrics)
- [ ] CLI utilities (scaffold agent config, run sessions)
- [ ] Metric collectors (latency, token usage, policy violation counts)
- [ ] Plugin system (entry points or registry)
- [ ] Benchmark harness (reproducible scenario packs)

### Phase 4 – Hardening & Ecosystem
- [ ] PyPI release & versioning policy
- [ ] Documentation site (mkdocs or sphinx)
- [ ] Example notebooks:
  - [ ] Policy-governed debate
  - [ ] Tool-augmented analysis
  - [ ] Memory retrieval optimization
- [ ] Integration tests (multi-agent sessions)
- [ ] Performance profiling & caching (response + embedding)
- [ ] Reference deployments (container + minimal infra recipe)

### Stretch / Exploratory
- [ ] Meta-controller (agent that dynamically reconfigures others)
- [ ] Human-in-the-loop approval gates
- [ ] Reward modeling integration
- [ ] Graph-based memory indexing
- [ ] Multi-lingual policy enforcement
- [ ] Streaming agent collaboration with partial outputs

## Guiding Principles

1. Policy First: Governance embedded, not bolted on.
2. Composability: Small, swappable components with clean contracts.
3. Observability: Every significant cognitive action is traceable.
4. Deterministic Surfaces: Non-determinism localized; reproducibility where feasible.
5. Extensibility: Easy to add new tools, memory adapters, orchestration strategies.

---

## Configuration (Planned Pattern)

```yaml
orchestrator:
  mode: debate
  max_turns: 8
agents:
  - name: Analyst
    model: openai:gpt-4o
    tools: [search, retrieve_memory]
  - name: Critic
    model: openai:gpt-4o
    tools: [retrieve_memory]
policies:
  - name: disallow_sensitive_leak
    conditions:
      - type: regex
        target: message.content
        pattern: "(password|api_key|secret)"
    actions:
      - block
      - log_violation
```

## Contributing

Suggestions, discussions, and lightweight design critiques are welcome. Proposed changes aligning with the roadmap are easier to review. For substantial features, draft a short design note (problem, approach, surface, trade-offs).

## Disclaimer

This framework is experimental and not production-hardened. Policy and safety modules require independent validation before deployment in sensitive contexts.

## Status

Early scaffolding phase; README intentionally front-loads the intended direction so contributors can align.
