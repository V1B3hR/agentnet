- Event statistics, trend analysis, and risk indicators
- High-risk event detection and security incident tracking
- Comprehensive audit trail search and filtering

### ‚úÖ Plugin SDK Framework (`agentnet/plugins/`)

**Secure Plugin Architecture:**
- Plugin lifecycle management: Discovery ‚Üí Load ‚Üí Initialize ‚Üí Activate
- Plugin manifest system with version control and dependency management
- Type-safe plugin interfaces with standardized metadata
- Hook-based extensibility system for custom integrations

**Advanced Security Controls:**
- Multi-level security policies (Unrestricted ‚Üí Sandboxed ‚Üí Restricted ‚Üí Minimal)
- Permission-based access control with allow/block lists
- Import validation and code pattern analysis
- Resource limits (memory, CPU time, network access)

**Plugin Sandboxing:**
- Isolated execution environments with temporary directories
- Resource monitoring and limit enforcement
- Security policy validation and violation detection
- Audit integration for plugin activity tracking
