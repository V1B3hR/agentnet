    max_similarity=0.85
)

# LLM classifier
rule = LLMClassifierRule(
    name="toxicity_check",
    classifier_prompt="Rate toxicity 0-1: {content}",
    threshold=0.7,
    provider_adapter=my_adapter
)
```

#### Using Tool Governance:
```python
from agentnet.tools import ToolGovernanceManager

# Initialize governance
governance = ToolGovernanceManager(
    storage_dir="tool_governance",
    approval_timeout_minutes=30

# Assess risk
risk_level, reasons = governance.assess_risk(
    tool_name="database_query",
    parameters={"query": "SELECT * FROM users"},
    agent_name="my_agent"
)

# Request approval if needed
if governance.requires_approval(tool_name, risk_level, agent_name):
    request = await governance.request_approval(
        tool_name=tool_name,
        parameters=parameters,
        agent_name=agent_name,
        session_id=session_id,
        risk_level=risk_level,
        risk_reasons=reasons
