   - Current: agentnet/core/cost/* basic structure exists
   - Missing: Full integration with agents and sessions

10. **Observability Metrics Dependencies**

## 🟢 Low Priority & Ongoing Maintenance

10. **Documentation Updates**
    - Regularly update README and roadmap docs.
    - Add guides, onboarding, diagrams.

11. **Sprint Breakdown / Phase Planning**
    - Refine sprint breakdowns and milestones.
    - Keep planning docs accurate and actionable.

12. **General Maintenance (Code, Tests, Docs)**
    - Address bugs, refactor and optimize code.
    - Maintain and expand test suites.
    - Keep dependency versions up to date.

13. **Review and Update Completed Roadmap Items**
    - Audit delivered features for improvements.
    - Ensure documentation and implementation summaries are current.


## In-Progress & Missing Items

- **✅ Security/Isolation**: COMPLETED - Fully implemented and tested with comprehensive test coverage.
- **Tool System & Policy Extensions**: Submodules present, but some advanced governance and custom tool features are still in progress.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Documentation lists steps (lint, tests, build, deploy), but full automated pipeline setup is not fully evidenced in code.
- **Risk Register**: Exists as a documented item, but no code or workflow integration is evident.
- **Cost Tracking Flow**: Main modules are present, integration and advanced features (predictive modeling) shown as partially complete.

## Implementation Evidence

- **Implementation Summaries**: Each phase (P0-P5) has a dedicated summary file (e.g., `docs/P1_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`) marking status as "COMPLETE" with lists of delivered features, technical details, and performance results.
- **API Endpoints**: `/tasks/plan`, `/tasks/execute`, `/eval/run` are implemented, tested via `tests/test_p3_api.py`, and documented in `docs/P3_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`.
- **Core Modules**: Source code structure matches roadmap layouts (`agentnet/core/`, `agentnet/tools/`, `agentnet/memory/`, etc.).
- **Testing**: Dedicated test directories (`/tests/unit`, `/tests/integration`) and evidence of test coverage and results in summary docs and test files.
- **Documentation**: Extensive docs in `docs/`, linked from README and site navigation, covering architecture, API, examples, and usage guides.

---

## Documentation & Readme Status

- **README.md**: Up-to-date with links to docs, examples, architecture, and contribution guides.
- **Roadmap Documentation**: `docs/RoadmapAgentNet.md` is detailed, matches actual module/files, and is referenced from the site and README.
- **Implementation Docs**: All major delivered phases (P0-P5) have corresponding implementation summary files verifying delivered features, test results, and next steps.

## Conclusion

**AUDIT FINDINGS: Significant gaps found between claimed and actual implementation status.**

### Accurate Status Summary:
- **Fully Implemented & Working**: 8/24 items (33%)
- **Partially Implemented**: 10/24 items (42%) 
- **Not Implemented/Broken**: 4/24 items (17%)
- **Documentation Only**: 2/24 items (8%)

### Critical Issues Discovered:
1. **✅ RESOLVED - Dependency Crisis**: All core dependencies now properly declared in requirements.txt
2. **✅ RESOLVED - Test Suite Broken**: Test suite now functional with pytest properly installed
3. **✅ RESOLVED - Security Claims**: Security features fully implemented with comprehensive isolation
4. **CI/CD Missing**: No actual automation despite documentation

### What Actually Works:
- Core AgentNet architecture and modular structure
- Memory system implementation
- API endpoint definitions
- Task graph and orchestration logic
- Comprehensive documentation and planning
- **✅ Security & Isolation**: Full implementation with multi-tenant isolation, resource locking, network policies
- **✅ Authentication**: JWT tokens, RBAC, session management

### What Needs Immediate Attention:
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Install missing dependencies (pytest, pydantic, prometheus-client) - now in requirements.txt
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Fix broken import statements - dependencies declared, working after installation
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Implement security features - fully implemented with comprehensive tests
- ❌ **INCOMPLETE**: Create actual CI/CD pipeline - no .github/workflows/ directory

**Update: Repository has made significant progress. Security & isolation features are now fully implemented and tested. Dependency management is resolved. Main remaining gap is CI/CD automation.**
