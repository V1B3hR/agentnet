## Implementation Evidence

- **Implementation Summaries**: Each phase (P0-P5) has a dedicated summary file (e.g., `docs/P1_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`) marking status as "COMPLETE" with lists of delivered features, technical details, and performance results.
- **API Endpoints**: `/tasks/plan`, `/tasks/execute`, `/eval/run` are implemented, tested via `tests/test_p3_api.py`, and documented in `docs/P3_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`.
- **Core Modules**: Source code structure matches roadmap layouts (`agentnet/core/`, `agentnet/tools/`, `agentnet/memory/`, etc.).
- **Testing**: Dedicated test directories (`/tests/unit`, `/tests/integration`) and evidence of test coverage and results in summary docs and test files.
- **Documentation**: Extensive docs in `docs/`, linked from README and site navigation, covering architecture, API, examples, and usage guides.

---

## In-Progress & Missing Items

- **Security/Isolation**: Partially implemented and documented. Needs further code and test evidence.
- **Tool System & Policy Extensions**: Submodules present, but some advanced governance and custom tool features are still in progress.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Documentation lists steps (lint, tests, build, deploy), but full automated pipeline setup is not fully evidenced in code.
- **Risk Register**: Exists as a documented item, but no code or workflow integration is evident.
- **Cost Tracking Flow**: Main modules are present, integration and advanced features (predictive modeling) shown as partially complete.

---

## Documentation & Readme Status

- **README.md**: Up-to-date with links to docs, examples, architecture, and contribution guides.
- **Roadmap Documentation**: `docs/RoadmapAgentNet.md` is detailed, matches actual module/files, and is referenced from the site and README.
- **Implementation Docs**: All major delivered phases (P0-P5) have corresponding implementation summary files verifying delivered features, test results, and next steps.

---

## Conclusion

Most roadmap items for AgentNet are verifiably implemented, documented, and tested, with evidence across code, tests, and docs. A few advanced items remain in progress (security, governance, CI/CD, cost tracking) but are tracked and partially delivered. The roadmap and README accurately reflect repository status.
