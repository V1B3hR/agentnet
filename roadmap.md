This comprehensive to-do list covers all items from the roadmap audit, sorted by priority (high, medium, low) and including ongoing maintenance tasks. Each item references its status and next actionable steps.

---

## 🔝 High Priority (CRITICAL - Blocks Basic Functionality)

1. **Fix Dependency Management Crisis**
   - Install missing critical dependencies: pytest, pydantic, prometheus-client, opentelemetry-api
   - Create proper requirements.txt or update pyproject.toml
   - Enable basic test execution

2. **Security & Isolation Implementation**
   - Implement claimed security features (currently only basic auth structure exists)
   - Add actual isolation mechanisms (currently not implemented)
   - Create security testing suite

3. **Message/Turn Schema Completion**
   - Fix pydantic import errors in agentnet/schemas/
   - Make schema validation actually functional
   - Complete JSON contract implementation

4. **Test Infrastructure Repair**
   - Fix broken test suite (pytest dependency missing)
   - Make NFR tests executable
   - Verify component coverage tests work

5. **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation**
   - Create actual .github/workflows/ (currently none exist)
   - Implement automated testing pipeline
   - Add Docker containerization (no Dockerfile found)

---

## 🟠 Medium Priority (Partial Implementations Need Completion)

6. **Tool System Extensions**
   - Complete advanced governance and custom tool features
   - Current: agentnet/tools/* basic structure exists
   - Missing: Advanced governance, full tool integration

7. **Policy & Governance Extensions**
   - Complete advanced policy modules for agent orchestration
   - Current: agentnet/core/policy/* basic implementation
   - Missing: Advanced policy enforcement, full integration

8. **LLM Provider Adapter Expansion**
   - Add more than just ExampleEngine provider
   - Current: agentnet/providers/ has base + example only
   - Missing: OpenAI, Anthropic, other production adapters

9. **Cost Tracking Flow Integration**
   - Complete end-to-end cost tracking integration
   - Current: agentnet/core/cost/* basic structure exists
   - Missing: Full integration with agents and sessions

10. **Observability Metrics Dependencies**
    - Fix prometheus-client and OpenTelemetry dependency issues
    - Current: Structure exists but deps missing
    - Missing: Working metrics collection

---

## 🟢 Low Priority & Ongoing Maintenance

10. **Documentation Updates**
    - Regularly update README and roadmap docs.
    - Add guides, onboarding, diagrams.

11. **Sprint Breakdown / Phase Planning**
    - Refine sprint breakdowns and milestones.
    - Keep planning docs accurate and actionable.

12. **General Maintenance (Code, Tests, Docs)**
    - Address bugs, refactor and optimize code.
    - Maintain and expand test suites.
    - Keep dependency versions up to date.

13. **Review and Update Completed Roadmap Items**
    - Audit delivered features for improvements.
    - Ensure documentation and implementation summaries are current.


## In-Progress & Missing Items

- **Security/Isolation**: Partially implemented and documented. Needs further code and test evidence.
- **Tool System & Policy Extensions**: Submodules present, but some advanced governance and custom tool features are still in progress.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Documentation lists steps (lint, tests, build, deploy), but full automated pipeline setup is not fully evidenced in code.
- **Risk Register**: Exists as a documented item, but no code or workflow integration is evident.
- **Cost Tracking Flow**: Main modules are present, integration and advanced features (predictive modeling) shown as partially complete.

---

## Implementation Evidence

- **Implementation Summaries**: Each phase (P0-P5) has a dedicated summary file (e.g., `docs/P1_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`) marking status as "COMPLETE" with lists of delivered features, technical details, and performance results.
- **API Endpoints**: `/tasks/plan`, `/tasks/execute`, `/eval/run` are implemented, tested via `tests/test_p3_api.py`, and documented in `docs/P3_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`.
- **Core Modules**: Source code structure matches roadmap layouts (`agentnet/core/`, `agentnet/tools/`, `agentnet/memory/`, etc.).
- **Testing**: Dedicated test directories (`/tests/unit`, `/tests/integration`) and evidence of test coverage and results in summary docs and test files.
- **Documentation**: Extensive docs in `docs/`, linked from README and site navigation, covering architecture, API, examples, and usage guides.

---



---

## Documentation & Readme Status

- **README.md**: Up-to-date with links to docs, examples, architecture, and contribution guides.
- **Roadmap Documentation**: `docs/RoadmapAgentNet.md` is detailed, matches actual module/files, and is referenced from the site and README.
- **Implementation Docs**: All major delivered phases (P0-P5) have corresponding implementation summary files verifying delivered features, test results, and next steps.

---

## Conclusion

**AUDIT FINDINGS: Significant gaps found between claimed and actual implementation status.**

### Accurate Status Summary:
- **Fully Implemented & Working**: 8/24 items (33%)
- **Partially Implemented**: 10/24 items (42%) 
- **Not Implemented/Broken**: 4/24 items (17%)
- **Documentation Only**: 2/24 items (8%)

### Critical Issues Discovered:
1. **Dependency Crisis**: Many core features fail due to missing Python packages
2. **Test Suite Broken**: Cannot run tests due to missing pytest dependency
3. **Security Claims False**: Claimed security features not actually implemented
4. **CI/CD Missing**: No actual automation despite documentation

### What Actually Works:
- Core AgentNet architecture and modular structure
- Memory system implementation
- API endpoint definitions
- Task graph and orchestration logic
- Comprehensive documentation and planning

### What Needs Immediate Attention:
- Install missing dependencies (pytest, pydantic, prometheus-client)
- Fix broken import statements
- Implement claimed security features
- Create actual CI/CD pipeline

**Previous conclusion claiming "most roadmap items are verifiably implemented" was inaccurate. The repository shows excellent architectural planning and documentation, but significant implementation gaps exist.**
