# AgentNet Roadmap Audit & Status Report

## Summary
The AgentNet repository has extensive documentation, implementation summaries, and clear roadmap tracking in both Markdown and HTML form. The audit below verifies each major roadmap item for implementation, documentation, and (where applicable) testing status. This version reflects the completed implementation of the Security & Isolation features (multi-tenant isolation, resource locking, network/data access policies, and integration tests) and resolves previously conflicting status reporting.
