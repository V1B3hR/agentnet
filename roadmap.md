# AgentNet Roadmap Audit & Status Report

## Summary
The AgentNet repository has extensive documentation, implementation summaries, and clear roadmap tracking in both Markdown and HTML form. The audit below verifies each major roadmap item for implementation, documentation, and (where applicable) testing status. This version reflects the completed implementation of the Security & Isolation features (multi-tenant isolation, resource locking, network/data access policies, and integration tests) and resolves previously conflicting status reporting.

```

**Remaining Issues:**
- CI/CD automation missing (no GitHub Actions workflows)
- Tool, policy, and provider ecosystems need expansion:
  - Tool System Extensions: Tool capability registration, lifecycle hooks, real provider implementations, versioning
  - Policy & Governance: Hierarchical policy composition, runtime enforcement engine, automated remediation, policy templates
  - LLM Provider Adapters: OpenAI (GPT-4, streaming, function calling), Anthropic (Claude, tool use), Azure (managed identity), local models (Ollama, vLLM)
  - Observability Enhancements: Grafana dashboards, distributed trace correlation, real-time alerting, custom exporters
- Risk register not tied to runtime enforcement or monitoring
- ✅ Container deployment assets added (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml)
- ✅ networkx added to requirements.txt (was only in pyproject.toml)

**Recently Resolved:**
- ✅ Cost tracking now fully integrated with agent/session lifecycle (session_id, agent_name support, breakdowns in cost summaries)
- ✅ Container deployment assets added (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL, Redis, Prometheus, Grafana)
- ✅ networkx dependency added to requirements.txt (was only in pyproject.toml, causing DAG test failures)

# AgentNet Roadmap: Complete To-Do List (Priority Ordered)

## 🔝 High Priority (Critical / Core Platform Integrity)

1. ✅ Dependency Management Stabilization (Completed)
2. ✅ Security & Isolation Foundation
   - Multi-tenant boundary enforcement
   - Isolation levels (basic / standard / strict)
   - Resource locking + session lifecycle cleanup
   - Network and data access policy layers
   - Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration)
3. ✅ Message / Turn Schema (Stable JSON contract)
4. ✅ Test Infrastructure (pytest + async support)
5. CI/CD Pipeline (Not Implemented)
   - Add .github/workflows (lint, type-check, tests, build)
   - Introduce coverage thresholds
   - (Optional) Add build + publish stages

## 🟠 Medium Priority (Expansion & Maturity)

6. Tool System Extensions (governance, lifecycle hooks, capability registration)
   - Needs expansion: 
     - Advanced governance: Tool capability registration system, lifecycle hooks (pre/post execution), custom validators beyond examples
     - Real providers: Production-ready tool implementations (file system, database, API integrations) beyond example tools
     - Tool versioning and deprecation management
7. Policy & Governance (hierarchical policy composition, enforcement engine)
   - Needs expansion:
     - Hierarchical policy composition: Parent-child policy inheritance, policy override mechanisms, tenant-level policy hierarchies
     - Enforcement engine: Runtime policy enforcement with circuit breakers, policy violation tracking, automated remediation hooks
     - Policy templates and libraries for common use cases
8. LLM Provider Adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, local models)
   - Needs expansion:
     - OpenAI: GPT-4, GPT-3.5 adapters with streaming, function calling, vision support
     - Anthropic: Claude adapter with prompt caching, tool use, extended context
     - Azure: Azure OpenAI integration with managed identity, private endpoints
     - Local models: Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio adapters with model management
     - Provider fallback chains and cost optimization strategies
9. ✅ Cost Tracking Integration (per-call metering, roll-up per agent/session) - COMPLETED
10. Observability Enhancements (dashboards, distributed traces correlation)
    - Needs expansion:
      - Dashboards: Grafana dashboards for agent performance, cost metrics, error rates, system health
      - Distributed traces correlation: Cross-service trace propagation, trace sampling strategies, trace-to-logs correlation
      - Real-time alerting: Alert rules for anomalies, cost spikes, performance degradation
      - Custom metrics exporters for various observability platforms (Datadog, New Relic, etc.)

## 🟢 Low Priority & Ongoing Maintenance

11. Documentation depth (deployment guide, ops runbook, security hardening)
12. Sprint & Phase Planning Iteration
13. Test coverage expansion (edge cases, chaos scenarios)
14. Refactoring & performance optimization (hot paths in orchestration)
15. Periodic roadmap review & status verification

---

## In-Progress & Not Yet Integrated

- Tool & Policy governance (partial scaffolding - needs advanced governance with lifecycle hooks, capability registration, and production tool providers)
- ✅ Cost flow instrumentation (COMPLETED - now integrated with agent/session lifecycle)
- CI/CD automation (absent - needs GitHub Actions workflows for lint, test, build, deploy)
- Risk Register (implemented but not tied to runtime enforcement or monitoring - needs integration with policy engine and alerting)
- Advanced evaluation scenarios (benchmark harness partially populated - needs expanded test scenarios, performance benchmarks, stress tests)

---

## ✅ Completed (Monitor for regression)

- Product Vision / Core Use Cases
- Functional & Non-Functional baselines (core implemented; some NFR tests pending refinement)
- Architecture & Component Layout
- Memory Layer & Schema Foundations
- Orchestration & Task Graph Execution
- Security & Isolation (newly completed)
- Observability (baseline metrics/tracing)
- Evaluation Harness (baseline)
- Phase Roadmap & Sprint Breakdown

---

## Conclusion

Updated audit reflects completion of Security & Isolation and Cost Tracking Integration features. Core architectural pillars are in place; maturity work now centers on ecosystem breadth (providers, tools, policies), operational automation (CI/CD, containerization), and deeper integration layers (risk runtime enforcement & monitoring).

### Status Snapshot
- Fully Implemented & Working: 13/24 (54.2%) - includes cost tracking, container deployment, DAG orchestration
- Partially Implemented: 8/24 (33.3%) - includes risk register (not runtime-integrated)
- Not Implemented / Blocked: 1/24 (4.2%)  (CI/CD)
- Documentation Only: 2/24 (8.3%)

### Working Foundations
- Multi-tenant isolation & access controls
- Orchestration + task graph execution
- Schema validation / API surface
- Observability instrumentation (baseline)
- Evaluation harness + test execution pipeline (local)
- Cost tracking with agent/session lifecycle integration

### Outstanding Gaps
- CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions workflows for lint, test, build, deploy)
- Provider ecosystem expansion:
  - OpenAI: GPT-4, streaming, function calling, vision support
  - Anthropic: Claude adapter with tool use and extended context
  - Azure: Azure OpenAI with managed identity
  - Local models: Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio adapters
- Advanced governance:
  - Hierarchical policy composition with inheritance
  - Runtime enforcement engine with circuit breakers
  - Advanced tool lifecycle (registration, versioning, hooks)
