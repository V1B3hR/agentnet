# AgentNet Roadmap Audit & Status Report

## Summary
The AgentNet repository has extensive documentation, implementation summaries, and clear roadmap tracking in both Markdown and HTML form. The audit below verifies each major roadmap item for implementation, documentation, and (where applicable) testing status. This version reflects the completed implementation of the Security & Isolation features (multi-tenant isolation, resource locking, network/data access policies, and integration tests) and resolves previously conflicting status reporting.

Legend: ✅ = Verifiably Complete (Green), 🟠 = Partially Implemented (Orange), 🔴 = Not Implemented/Blocked (Red), N/A = Not required/applicable

**Critical Issues Found (RESOLVED in current version):**
- ✅ Dependencies declared: pytest, pydantic, prometheus-client, opentelemetry-api, networkx
- ✅ Test execution: pytest suite runnable after installation

- ✅ Observability: metrics/tracing imports work with declared dependencies
- ✅ Security & Isolation: fully implemented (multi-tenant isolation, resource locking, network/data policy layers, isolation levels, integration + unit tests)
- ✅ DAG orchestration: networkx now in requirements.txt for task graph execution

**How to Install Dependencies:**
```bash
# Core
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Editable dev
pip install -e .

# Full (optional extras)
pip install -e .[full,dev,docs]
```

**Remaining Issues:**
- CI/CD automation missing (no GitHub Actions workflows)
- Tool, policy, and provider ecosystems need expansion:
  - Tool System Extensions: advanced governance, real providers
  - Policy & Governance: hierarchical policy composition, enforcement engine
  - LLM Provider Adapters: OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, local models
  - Observability Enhancements: dashboards, distributed traces correlation
- Risk register not tied to runtime enforcement or monitoring
- ✅ Container deployment assets added (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml)
- ✅ networkx added to requirements.txt (was only in pyproject.toml)

**Recently Resolved:**
- ✅ Cost tracking now fully integrated with agent/session lifecycle (session_id, agent_name support, breakdowns in cost summaries)
- ✅ Container deployment assets added (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL, Redis, Prometheus, Grafana)
- ✅ networkx dependency added to requirements.txt (was only in pyproject.toml, causing DAG test failures)

   - Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration)
3. ✅ Message / Turn Schema (Stable JSON contract)
4. ✅ Test Infrastructure (pytest + async support)
5. CI/CD Pipeline (Not Implemented)

   - Introduce coverage thresholds
   - (Optional) Add build + publish stages

## 🟠 Medium Priority (Expansion & Maturity)

6. Tool System Extensions (governance, lifecycle hooks, capability registration)
   - Needs expansion: advanced governance, real providers
7. Policy & Governance (hierarchical policy composition, enforcement engine)
   - Needs expansion: hierarchical policy composition, enforcement engine
8. LLM Provider Adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, local models)

10. Observability Enhancements (dashboards, distributed traces correlation)
    - Needs expansion: dashboards, distributed traces correlation

## 🟢 Low Priority & Ongoing Maintenance

11. Documentation depth (deployment guide, ops runbook, security hardening)
12. Sprint & Phase Planning Iteration
13. Test coverage expansion (edge cases, chaos scenarios)
14. Refactoring & performance optimization (hot paths in orchestration)
15. Periodic roadmap review & status verification

---

## In-Progress & Not Yet Integrated

- Tool & Policy governance (partial scaffolding - needs advanced governance, real providers)
- ✅ Cost flow instrumentation (COMPLETED - now integrated with agent/session lifecycle)
- CI/CD automation (absent)
- Risk Register (implemented but not tied to runtime enforcement or monitoring)
- Advanced evaluation scenarios (benchmark harness partially populated)

---

## ✅ Completed (Monitor for regression)

- Product Vision / Core Use Cases
- Functional & Non-Functional baselines (core implemented; some NFR tests pending refinement)
- Architecture & Component Layout
- Memory Layer & Schema Foundations
- Orchestration & Task Graph Execution
- Security & Isolation (newly completed)
- Observability (baseline metrics/tracing)
- Evaluation Harness (baseline)
- Phase Roadmap & Sprint Breakdown
- Cost Tracking & Integration (agent/session lifecycle support)

---

## Implementation Evidence

- Orchestration & DAG: `agentnet/core/orchestration/`
- Schemas: `agentnet/schemas/`
- API endpoints: `api/server.py`, tested in `tests/test_p3_api.py`
- Evaluation harness: `agentnet/core/eval/`
- Cost tracking scaffolding: `agentnet/core/cost/`
- Documentation: `docs/` (phase summaries, roadmap, implementation reports)

---

## Documentation & Readme Status

- README current (architecture, usage, links)
- Roadmap documentation consistent with repository structure
- Implementation summaries (P0–P5) present
- Security implementation report & guide added

---

## Conclusion

Updated audit reflects completion of Security & Isolation and Cost Tracking Integration features. Core architectural pillars are in place; maturity work now centers on ecosystem breadth (providers, tools, policies), operational automation (CI/CD, containerization), and deeper integration layers (risk runtime enforcement & monitoring).

### Status Snapshot
- Fully Implemented & Working: 13/24 (54.2%) - includes cost tracking, container deployment, DAG orchestration
- Partially Implemented: 8/24 (33.3%) - includes risk register (not runtime-integrated)
- Not Implemented / Blocked: 1/24 (4.2%)  (CI/CD)
- Documentation Only: 2/24 (8.3%)

### Working Foundations
- Multi-tenant isolation & access controls
- Orchestration + task graph execution
- Schema validation / API surface
- Observability instrumentation (baseline)
- Evaluation harness + test execution pipeline (local)
- Cost tracking with agent/session lifecycle integration

### Outstanding Gaps
- CI/CD automation
- Provider ecosystem expansion (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, local models - real provider implementations needed)
- Advanced governance (hierarchical policy composition, enforcement engine, advanced tool lifecycle)
- ✅ Container deployment assets (Docker, docker-compose) - ADDED
- Risk register runtime enforcement & monitoring integration
- Observability enhancements (dashboards, distributed traces correlation)
