- ✅ Test execution: pytest suite runnable after installation
- ✅ Schema validation: pydantic-based models functioning
- ✅ Observability: metrics/tracing imports work with declared dependencies
- ✅ Security & Isolation: multi-tenant isolation, resource locking, network/data policy layers, isolation levels, unit + integration tests
- ✅ DAG orchestration: networkx now in requirements.txt for task graph execution

**How to Install Dependencies:**
```bash
# Core
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Editable dev
pip install -e .

# Full (optional extras)
pip install -e .[full,dev,docs]
```

- ✅ Observability enhancements (Grafana dashboards, distributed trace correlation, real-time alerting, custom exporters)
- ✅ Cost tracking integrated with agent/session lifecycle (session_id, agent_name, cost breakdowns)
- ✅ Container deployment assets (PostgreSQL, Redis, Prometheus, Grafana)
- ✅ networkx dependency alignment (fixed DAG test failures)
- ✅ Tool & Policy governance (capability registration, lifecycle hooks, custom validators, production providers, versioning, policy templates, enforcement engine)
- ✅ Risk Register runtime integration (policy engine + alerting)
- ✅ Advanced evaluation scenarios (benchmarks, performance, stress tests)

# AgentNet Roadmap: Complete To-Do List (Priority Ordered)

## 🔝 High Priority (Critical / Core Platform Integrity)
1. ✅ Dependency Management Stabilization
2. ✅ Security & Isolation Foundation
   - Multi-tenant boundaries; isolation levels (basic/standard/strict)
   - Resource locking; session lifecycle cleanup
   - Network & data access policy layers
   - Comprehensive unit + integration tests
3. ✅ Message / Turn Schema (Stable JSON contract)
4. ✅ Test Infrastructure (pytest + async)
5. CI/CD Pipeline (Not Implemented)
   - Lint, type-check, test, build workflows
   - Coverage thresholds
   - (Optional) build + publish stages

## 🟠 Medium Priority (Expansion & Maturity)
6. ✅ Tool System Extensions (governance, lifecycle hooks, capability registration)
7. ✅ Policy & Governance (hierarchical composition, enforcement engine)
8. ✅ LLM Provider Adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, local models)
9. ✅ Cost Tracking Integration (per-call + roll-up)
10. ✅ Observability Enhancements (dashboards, traces correlation, alerting, exporters)

## 🟢 Low Priority & Ongoing Maintenance
11. Documentation depth (deployment guide, ops runbook, security hardening)
12. Sprint & Phase Planning Iteration
13. Test coverage expansion (edge cases, chaos/chaotic scenarios)
14. Refactoring & performance optimization (orchestration hot paths)
15. Periodic roadmap review & status verification

---

## Documentation & Readme Status
- README current (architecture, usage, links)
- Roadmap documentation aligned with repository
- Implementation summaries (P0–P5) present
- Security implementation report & guide included

---

## Conclusion
Current audit confirms maturity across core architecture, governance, security, orchestration, evaluation, cost instrumentation, provider ecosystem, and observability. Primary remaining gap: CI/CD automation.

### Status Snapshot
- Fully Implemented & Working: 19/24 (79.2%)
- Partially Implemented: 2/24 (8.3%)
