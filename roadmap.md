# AgentNet Roadmap Audit & Status Report

## Summary
The AgentNet repository has extensive documentation, implementation summaries, and clear roadmap tracking in both Markdown and HTML form. The audit below verifies each major roadmap item for implementation, documentation, and (where applicable) testing status. This version reflects the completed implementation of the Security & Isolation features (multi-tenant isolation, resource locking, network/data access policies, and integration tests) and resolves previously conflicting status reporting.

Legend: ✅ = Verifiably Complete (Green), 🟠 = Partially Implemented (Orange), 🔴 = Not Implemented/Blocked (Red), N/A = Not required/applicable

**Critical Issues Found (RESOLVED in current version):**
- ✅ Dependencies declared: pytest, pydantic, prometheus-client, opentelemetry-api
- ✅ Test execution: pytest suite runnable after installation
- ✅ Schema validation: pydantic-based models functioning
- ✅ Observability: metrics/tracing imports work with declared dependencies
- ✅ Security & Isolation: fully implemented (multi-tenant isolation, resource locking, network/data policy layers, isolation levels, integration + unit tests)

**How to Install Dependencies:**
```bash
# Core
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Editable dev
pip install -e .

# Full (optional extras)
pip install -e .[full,dev,docs]
```

**Remaining Issues:**
- CI/CD automation missing (no GitHub Actions workflows)
- Cost tracking not fully integrated with agent/session lifecycle
- Tool, policy, and provider ecosystems need expansion (advanced governance, real providers)
- Risk register not tied to runtime enforcement or monitoring
- No Dockerfile / container deployment assets
- Some advanced orchestration & DAG tests require optional deps (e.g. networkx)

# AgentNet Roadmap: Complete To-Do List (Priority Ordered)

## 🔝 High Priority (Critical / Core Platform Integrity)

1. ✅ Dependency Management Stabilization (Completed)
2. ✅ Security & Isolation Foundation
   - Multi-tenant boundary enforcement
   - Isolation levels (basic / standard / strict)
   - Resource locking + session lifecycle cleanup
   - Network and data access policy layers
   - Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration)
3. ✅ Message / Turn Schema (Stable JSON contract)
4. ✅ Test Infrastructure (pytest + async support)
5. CI/CD Pipeline (Not Implemented)
   - Add .github/workflows (lint, type-check, tests, build)
   - Introduce coverage thresholds
   - (Optional) Add build + publish stages

## 🟠 Medium Priority (Expansion & Maturity)

6. Tool System Extensions (governance, lifecycle hooks, capability registration)
7. Policy & Governance (hierarchical policy composition, enforcement engine)
8. LLM Provider Adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, local models)
9. Cost Tracking Integration (per-call metering, roll-up per agent/session)
10. Observability Enhancements (dashboards, distributed traces correlation)

## 🟢 Low Priority & Ongoing Maintenance

11. Documentation depth (deployment guide, ops runbook, security hardening)
12. Sprint & Phase Planning Iteration
13. Test coverage expansion (edge cases, chaos scenarios)
14. Refactoring & performance optimization (hot paths in orchestration)
15. Periodic roadmap review & status verification

---

## In-Progress & Not Yet Integrated

- Tool & Policy governance (partial scaffolding)
- Cost flow instrumentation (basic structures only)
- CI/CD automation (absent)
- Risk Register (static doc; lacks runtime linkage)
- Advanced evaluation scenarios (benchmark harness partially populated)

---

## ✅ Completed (Monitor for regression)

- Product Vision / Core Use Cases
- Functional & Non-Functional baselines (core implemented; some NFR tests pending refinement)
- Architecture & Component Layout
- Memory Layer & Schema Foundations
- Orchestration & Task Graph Execution
- Security & Isolation (newly completed)
- Observability (baseline metrics/tracing)
- Evaluation Harness (baseline)
- Phase Roadmap & Sprint Breakdown

---

## Implementation Evidence

- Security isolation implementation: `agentnet/core/auth/*`, `tests/test_security_integration.py`, `demos/security_isolation_demo.py`
- Orchestration & DAG: `agentnet/core/orchestration/`
- Schemas: `agentnet/schemas/`
- API endpoints: `api/server.py`, tested in `tests/test_p3_api.py`
- Evaluation harness: `agentnet/core/eval/`
- Cost tracking scaffolding: `agentnet/core/cost/`
- Documentation: `docs/` (phase summaries, roadmap, implementation reports)

---

## Documentation & Readme Status

- README current (architecture, usage, links)
- Roadmap documentation consistent with repository structure
- Implementation summaries (P0–P5) present
- Security implementation report & guide added

---

## Conclusion

Updated audit reflects completion of the Security & Isolation feature set. Core architectural pillars are in place; maturity work now centers on ecosystem breadth (providers, tools, policies), operational automation (CI/CD, containerization), and deeper integration layers (cost tracking, risk linkage).

### Status Snapshot
- Fully Implemented & Working: 9/24 (37.5%)
- Partially Implemented: 10/24 (41.7%)
- Not Implemented / Blocked: 3/24 (12.5%)  (CI/CD, Risk (code-level), advanced cost integration)
- Documentation Only: 2/24 (8.3%)

### Working Foundations
- Multi-tenant isolation & access controls
- Orchestration + task graph execution
- Schema validation / API surface
- Observability instrumentation (baseline)
- Evaluation harness + test execution pipeline (local)

### Outstanding Gaps
- CI/CD automation
- Provider ecosystem expansion
- Advanced governance (policy + tool lifecycle)
- Cost tracking integration path
- Operational deployment assets (Docker, infra guidance)
